# Technical test for frontend developers – Event Attendance 🎫

## Introduction 👋
Welcome to Wuolah’s technical test for frontend developers.  
We want to evaluate how you solve a practical case that simulates the challenges of building user interfaces in the academic environment.

## The test 📝

### Basic requirements
Develop a user interface for managing event attendance, implementing the following functionalities:

1. **List events:**  
   *As a user, I want to view a list of available events* (e.g., music festivals, conferences, fairs, etc.). 🎉

2. **Event details:**  
   *As a user, I want to view the details of a specific event*, including title, description, date, and location. 📅

3. **Mark/Change attendance:**  
   *As a user, I want to confirm my attendance at an event* and, if necessary, cancel or update my attendance. 👍/👎

4. **List attendees:**  
   *As a user, I want to see a list of users who have confirmed attendance for a specific event.* 👥

Use React (preferably the LTS version) and any tools you typically use in a real-world application.

### Bonus ✨
The interface should display a reminder notification to users who have confirmed attendance one week before the event.  
Please provide your theoretical approach on how you would implement this processing (implementation is not required).

## What we are evaluating 🔍
- **Understanding requirements & problem solving:**  
  Assess your ability to comprehend the requirements and design an effective interface.
- **Communication:**  
  Clearly articulate any doubts and explain your design decisions.
- **Adaptability to our stack:**  
  We value proficiency in React and adherence to frontend best practices.
- **UI/UX Design & Best Practices:**  
  Focus on modularity, testability, performance, and overall user experience.
- **Development principles:**  
  Consider the following:
  - **Idempotency:** The UI should behave consistently with valid inputs. 🔄
  - **Testability:** Provide tests to ensure your components work as expected. ✅
  - **Performance & Scalability:** Ensure your interface is efficient and responsive even with multiple interactions. ⚡

## Additional considerations 📌
- **Documentation:**  
  Provide clear documentation on your design and instructions for running your code.
- **Inline comments:**  
  Include inline comments to explain key or complex decisions.
- **Commits:**  
  Make frequent, descriptive commits that reflect your development process.
